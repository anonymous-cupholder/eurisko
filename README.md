"There was literally an ancient wizard who created a hidden artifact with legendary power, that he never shared with the world, until when he died, the seals (password on the directory) broke and the artifact was revealed" - Daj

## Notes

The whole program is contained in `EUR`. [seveno4](https://github.com/seveno4/EURISKO) is getting this running in [Medley Interlisp](https://interlisp.org/).

The [wiki](https://github.com/white-flame/eurisko/wiki) is open for people to post their knowledge and discoveries.

More to come, including the Traveller-specific stuff.
