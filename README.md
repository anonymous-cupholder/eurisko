# Doug Lenat's EURISKO from SAIL archives circa 1981

These files are extracted from the SAILDART archive maintained by Bruce Baumgart, in Douglas Lenat's AM section here: https://www.saildart.org/[AM,DBL]/ 

## Notes

The whole program is contained in `EUR`, and has been confirmed to run in Interlisp Medley.

More to come, including the Traveller-specific stuff.
